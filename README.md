# Datadog Serverless Workshop 2024

# Datadog's Serverless Observability on AWS Workshop

## Abstract
In this workshop you’ll learn about how to use Datadog’s Serverless APM to trace through popular AWS managed services like API Gateway, SNS, and SQS - and how you can use these insights to successfully operate your Serverless services at scale. You’ll see this firsthand by designing, deploying, and monitoring a fully serverless GitHub bot.

## Learning Objectives
- Go from zero Serverless AWS experience to deploying a Serverless app and monitoring it.
- Learn how to loop Datadog into the Serverless development process early (shift left).
- Develop, deploy, and monitor a serverless GitHub bot.
